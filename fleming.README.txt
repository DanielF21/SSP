When running the OD code you will be prompted with the question:

"Middle Observation?:"

type either 2 3 or 4 (the input file has 5 valid observations)
you will also be asked the question:

"yes?"

by typing 1 (yes) you are confirming the 2 3 or 4 middle observation
by typing 0 (no) you are making the first second and third observations the inputs


Hope you like the interpretive dance :)


P.S. 
I tried to make the Orbital Visualization work but it didn't so i just commented it out at the very bottom of the code
